# Project Suggestions
This is a list of projects that we could make open source contributions to at [Syntactic Sugar](https://twitter.com/syntaxSugarLdn).

## I want to suggest a project!
That's great, we want suggestions!  We try and focus on functional programming related open source projects in any language.  If there's a project you maintain, or want to contribute to, you can suggest it by filling in the [template](template.md) and making a PR.  We'll want to know:
 - what it does
 - any target issues
 - how to set it up
 - who could represent it while hacking

It's useful to have a representative in the room to give a bit of background to the issues.  You don't need to be a maintainer, or even a contributor, to represent a project, but you should feel comfortable explaining the issues to resolve.
